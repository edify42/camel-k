= File Based Configuration

File-based configuration is used to set command flags. Flag values do not need to be entered on a regular basis. The file is read on Kamel startup and the flags are set accordingly.

The file's default name is `kamel-config.yaml` . Which should be placed in either of this directory structure:

 - `~/.kamel/`
 - `./.kamel/`
 - `.`

it can be overridden by setting an env value `KAMEL_CONFIG_NAME` to file path.


To configure this flag, create a file named kamel-config.yaml on the same directory as your integration. The file must contain a yaml structure as shown below:

.Kamel-config.yaml

```yaml
kamel:
    install:
        namespace: kamel
        healthPort: 8081
        monitoringPort: 8082
```
